Rally
=====

Rally is the macrobenchmarking framework for Elasticsearch

What is Rally?
--------------

You want to benchmark Elasticsearch? Then Rally is for you. It can help you with the following tasks:

* Setup and teardown of an Elasticsearch cluster for benchmarking
* Management of benchmark data and specifications even across Elasticsearch versions
* Running benchmarks and recording results
* Finding performance problems by attaching so-called telemetry devices
* Comparing performance results

We have also put considerable effort in Rally to ensure that benchmarking data are reproducible.

Quick Start
-----------

Rally is developed for Unix and is actively tested on Linux and MacOS. Rally supports `benchmarking Elasticsearch clusters running on Windows <http://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html#benchmarking-an-existing-cluster>`_ but Rally itself needs to be installed on machines running Unix.

Installing Rally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note**: If you actively develop on Elasticsearch, we recommend that you `install Rally in development mode <https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing.html#installation-instructions-for-development>`_ instead as Elasticsearch is fast moving and Rally always adapts accordingly to the latest master version.

Install Python 3.8+ including ``pip3``, git 1.9+ and an `appropriate JDK to run Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm>`_ Be sure that ``JAVA_HOME`` points to that JDK. Then run the following command, optionally prefixed by ``sudo`` if necessary::

    pip3 install esrally


If you have any trouble or need more detailed instructions, please look in the `detailed installation guide <https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_.

Run your first race
-------------------

Now we're ready to run our first race::

    esrally race --distribution-version=6.0.0 --track=geonames

This will download Elasticsearch 6.0.0 and run Rally's default track - the `geonames track <https://github.com/elastic/rally-tracks/tree/master/geonames>`_ - against it. After the race, a summary report is written to the command line:::
