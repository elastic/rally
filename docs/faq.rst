Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

A benchmark aborts with ``Couldn't find a tar.gz distribution``. What's the problem?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when Rally cannot build an Elasticsearch distribution from source code. The most likely cause is that there is some problem building the Elasticsearch distribution.

To see what's the problem, try building Elasticsearch yourself. First, find out where the source code is located (run ``grep src ~/.rally/rally.ini``). Then change to the directory (``src.root.dir`` + ``elasticsearch.src.subdir`` which is usually ``~/.rally/benchmarks/src/elasticsearch``) and run the following commands::

    ./gradlew clean
    ./gradlew :distribution:tar:assemble

By that you are mimicking what Rally does. Fix any errors that show up here and then retry.

Where does Rally get the benchmark data from?
---------------------------------------------

Rally comes with a set of tracks out of the box which we maintain in the `rally-tracks repository on Github <https://github.com/elastic/rally-tracks>`_. This repository contains the track descriptions. The actual data are stored as compressed files in an S3 bucket.

Will Rally destroy my existing indices?
---------------------------------------

First of all: Please (please, please) do NOT run Rally against your production cluster if you are just getting started with it. You have been warned.

Depending on the track, Rally will delete and create one or more indices. For example, the `geonames track <https://github.com/elastic/rally-tracks/blob/master/geonames/track.json#L9>`_ specifies that Rally should create an index named "geonames" and Rally will assume it can do to this index whatever it wants. Specifically, Rally will check at the beginning of a race if the index "geonames" exists and delete it. After that it creates a new empty "geonames" index and runs the benchmark. So if you benchmark against your own cluster (by specifying the ``benchmark-only`` :doc:`pipeline </pipelines>`) and this cluster contains an index that is called "geonames" you will lose (all) data if you run Rally against it. Rally will neither read nor write (or delete) any other index. So if you apply the usual care nothing bad can happen.

What does `latency` and `service_time` mean and how do they related to the `took` field that Elasticsearch returns?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's start with the `took` field of Elasticsearch. `took` is the time needed by Elasticsearch to process a request. As it is determined on the server, it can neither include the time it took the client to send the data to Elasticsearch nor the time it took Elasticsearch to send it to the client. This time is captured by `service_time`, i.e. it is the time period from the start of a request (on the client) until it has received the response.

The explanation of `latency` is a bit more involved. First of all, Rally defines two benchmarking modes:

* Throughput benchmarking mode: In this mode, Rally will issue requests as fast as it can, i.e. as soon as it receives a response, it will issue the next request. This is ideal for benchmarking indexing. In this mode ``latency`` == ``service_time``.
* Throughput-throttled mode: If you define a specific target throughput rate in a track, for example 100 requests per second (you should choose this number based on the traffic pattern that you experience in your production environment), then Rally will define a schedule internally and will issue requests according to this schedule regardless how fast Elasticsearch can respond. To put it differently: Imagine you want to grab a coffee on your way to work. You make this decision independently of all the other people going to the coffee shop so it is possible that you need to wait before you can tell the barista which coffee you want. The time it takes the barista to make your coffee is the service time. The service time is independent of the number of customers in the coffee shop. However, you as a customer also care about the length of the waiting line which depends on the number of customers in the coffee shop. The time it takes between you entering the coffee shop and taking your first sip of coffee is latency.

If you are interested in latency measurement, we recommend you watch the following talks:

Where and how long does Rally keep its data?
--------------------------------------------

Rally stores a lot of data (this is just the nature of a benchmark) so you should keep an eye on disk usage. All data are kept in ``~/.rally`` and Rally does not implicitly delete them. These are the most important directories:

* ``~/.rally/logs``: Contains all log files. Logs are rotated daily. If you don't need the logs anymore, you can safely wipe this directory.
* ``~/.rally/benchmarks/races``: telemetry data, Elasticsearch logs and even complete Elasticsearch installations including the data directory if a benchmark failed. If you don't need the data anymore, you can safely wipe this directory.
* ``~/.rally/benchmarks/src``: the Elasticsearch Github repository (only if you had Rally build Elasticsearch from sources at least once).
* ``~/.rally/benchmarks/data``: the benchmark data sets. This directory can get very huge (way more than 100 GB if you want to try all default tracks). You can delete the files in this directory but keep in mind that Rally may needs to download them again.
* ``~/.rally/benchmarks/distributions``: Contains all downloaded Elasticsearch distributions.

There are a few more directories but the ones above are the most disk-hogging ones.

Does Rally spy on me?
---------------------

No. Rally does not collect or send any usage data and also the complete source code is open. We do value your feedback a lot though and if you got any ideas for improvements, found a bug or have any other feedback, please head over to `Rally's Discuss forum <https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch/rally>`_ or `raise an issue on Github <https://github.com/elastic/rally>`_.

Do I need an Internet connection?
---------------------------------

You do NOT need Internet access on any node of your Elasticsearch cluster but the machine where you start Rally needs an Internet connection to download track data sets and Elasticsearch distributions. After it has downloaded all data, an Internet connection is not required anymore and you can specify ``--offline``. If Rally detects no active Internet connection, it will automatically enable offline mode and warn you.

We have a dedicated documentation page for :doc:`running Rally offline </offline>` which should cover all necessary details.
