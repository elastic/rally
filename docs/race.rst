Run a Benchmark: Races
======================

Definition
----------

A "race" in Rally is the execution of a benchmarking experiment. You can choose different benchmarking scenarios (called :doc:`tracks </track>`) for your benchmarks.

List Tracks
-----------

Start by finding out which tracks are available::

    esrally list tracks

This will show the following list::

    Name        Description                                          Documents  Compressed Size    Uncompressed Size    Default Challenge        All Challenges

The first two columns show the name and a description of each track. A track also specifies one or more challenges which describe the workload to run.

Starting a Race
---------------

.. note::
    Do not run Rally as root as Elasticsearch will refuse to start with root privileges.

To start a race you have to define the track and challenge to run. For example::

    esrally --distribution-version=6.0.0 --track=geopoint --challenge=append-fast-with-conflicts

Rally will then start racing on this track. If you have never started Rally before, it should look similar to the following output::

    dm@io:~ $ esrally --distribution-version=6.0.0 --track=geopoint --challenge=append-fast-with-conflicts

        ____        ____
       / __ \____ _/ / /_  __
      / /_/ / __ `/ / / / / /
     / _, _/ /_/ / / / /_/ /
    /_/ |_|\__,_/_/_/\__, /
                    /____/

The benchmark will take a while to run, so be patient.

When the race has finished, Rally will show a summary on the command line::

.. note::
    You can save this report also to a file by using ``--report-file=/path/to/your/report.md`` and save it as CSV with ``--report-format=csv``.

What did Rally just do?

* It downloaded and started Elasticsearch 6.0.0
* It downloaded the relevant data for the geopoint track
* It ran the actual benchmark
* And finally it reported the results

If you are curious about the operations that Rally has run, inspect the `geopoint track specification <https://github.com/elastic/rally-tracks/blob/5/geopoint/track.json>`_ or start to :doc:`write your own tracks </adding_tracks>`. You can also configure Rally to :doc:`store all data samples in Elasticsearch </configuration>` so you can analyze the results with Kibana. Finally, you may want to :doc:`change the Elasticsearch configuration </car>`.
