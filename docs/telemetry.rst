Telemetry Devices
=================

You probably want to gain additional insights from a race. Therefore, we have added telemetry devices to Rally. If you invoke
``esrally list telemetry``, it will show which telemetry devices are available::

   dm@io:Projects/rally ‹master*›$ esrally list telemetry

       ____        ____
      / __ \____ _/ / /_  __
     / /_/ / __ `/ / / / / /
    / _, _/ /_/ / / / /_/ /
   /_/ |_|\__,_/_/_/\__, /
                   /____/


   Available telemetry devices:

   Command         Name                   Description
   --------------  ---------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------
   jit              JIT Compiler Profiler  Enables JIT compiler logs.
   gc               GC log                 Enables GC logs.
   jfr              Flight Recorder        Enables Java Flight Recorder (requires an Oracle JDK or OpenJDK 11+)
   heapdump         Heap Dump              Captures a heap dump.
   node-stats       Node Stats             Regularly samples node stats
   recovery-stats   Recovery Stats         Regularly samples shard recovery stats
   ccr-stats        CCR Stats              Regularly samples Cross Cluster Replication (CCR) related stats
   transform-stats  Transform Stats        Regularly samples transform stats

   Keep in mind that each telemetry device may incur a runtime overhead which can skew results.

You can attach one or more of these telemetry devices to the benchmarked cluster. Except for ``node-stats``, this only works if Rally provisions the cluster (i.e. it does not work with ``--pipeline=benchmark-only``).

jfr
---

The ``jfr`` telemetry device enables the `Java Flight Recorder <http://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jmc-5-5/jfr-runtime-guide/index.html>`_ on the benchmark candidate. Up to JDK 11, Java flight recorder ships only with Oracle JDK, so Rally assumes that Oracle JDK is used for benchmarking. If you run benchmarks on JDK 11 or later, Java flight recorder is also available on OpenJDK.

To enable ``jfr``, invoke Rally with ``esrally --telemetry jfr``. ``jfr`` will then write a flight recording file which can be opened in `Java Mission Control <https://jdk.java.net/jmc/>`_. Rally prints the location of the flight recording file on the command line.

Supported telemetry parameters:

* ``recording-template``: The name of a custom flight recording template. It is up to you to correctly install these recording templates on each target machine. If none is specified, the default recording template of Java flight recorder is used.

.. note::

   Up to JDK 11 Java flight recorder ship only with Oracle JDK and the licensing terms do not allow you to run it in production environments without a valid license (for details, refer to the `Oracle Java SE Advanced & Suite Products page <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/overview/index.html>`_). However, running in a QA environment is fine.

jit
---

The ``jit`` telemetry device enables JIT compiler logs for the benchmark candidate. If the HotSpot disassembler library is available, the logs will also contain the disassembled JIT compiler output which can be used for low-level analysis. We recommend to use `JITWatch <https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jitwatch>`_ for analysis.

``hsdis`` can be built for JDK 8 on Linux with (based on a `description by Alex Blewitt <http://alblue.bandlem.com/2016/09/javaone-hotspot.html>`_)::

   curl -O -O -O -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlloyd/openjdk/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/src/share/tools/hsdis/{hsdis.c,hsdis.h,Makefile,README}
   mkdir -p build/binutils
   curl http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.27.tar.gz | tar --strip-components=1 -C build/binutils -z -x -f -
   make BINUTILS=build/binutils ARCH=amd64

After it has been built, the binary needs to be copied to the JDK directory (see ``README`` of hsdis for details).

gc
--

The ``gc`` telemetry device enables GC logs for the benchmark candidate. You can use tools like `GCViewer <https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer>`_ to analyze the GC logs.

If the runtime JDK is Java 9 or higher, the following telemetry parameters can be specified:

* ``gc-log-config`` (default: ``gc*=info,safepoint=info,age*=trace``): The GC logging configuration consisting of a list of tags and levels. Run ``java -Xlog:help`` to see the list of available levels and tags.


.. note::

    Use a JSON file for ``telemetry-params`` as the simple parameter format is not supported for the GC log configuration string. See the :ref:`command line reference <clr_telemetry_params>` for details.

heapdump
--------

The ``heapdump`` telemetry device will capture a heap dump after a benchmark has finished and right before the node is shutdown.

node-stats
----------

.. warning::

    With ``Elasticsearch < 7.2.0``, using this telemetry device will skew your results because the node-stats API triggers additional refreshes.
    Additionally a lot of metrics get recorded impacting the measurement results even further.

The node-stats telemetry device regularly calls the `cluster node-stats API <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html>`_ and records metrics from the following sections:

* Indices stats (key ``indices`` in the node-stats API)
* Thread pool stats (key ``thread_pool`` in the node-stats API)
* JVM buffer pool stats (key ``jvm.buffer_pools`` in the node-stats API)
* JVM gc stats (key ``jvm.gc`` in the node-stats API)
* JVM mem stats (key ``jvm.mem`` in the node-stats API)
* Circuit breaker stats (key ``breakers`` in the node-stats API)
* Network-related stats (key ``transport`` in the node-stats API)
* Process cpu stats (key ``process.cpu`` in the node-stats API)

Supported telemetry parameters:

* ``node-stats-sample-interval`` (default: 1): A positive number greater than zero denoting the sampling interval in seconds.
* ``node-stats-include-indices`` (default: ``false``): A boolean indicating whether indices stats should be included.
* ``node-stats-include-indices-metrics`` (default: ``docs,store,indexing,search,merges,query_cache,fielddata,segments,translog,request_cache``): A comma-separated string specifying the Indices stats metrics to include. This is useful, for example, to restrict the collected Indices stats metrics. Specifying this parameter implicitly enables collection of Indices stats, so you don't also need to specify ``node-stats-include-indices: true``.

  Example: ``--telemetry-params="node-stats-include-indices-metrics:'docs'"`` will **only** collect the ``docs`` metrics from Indices stats. If you want to use multiple fields, pass a JSON file to ``telemetry-params`` (see the :ref:`command line reference <clr_telemetry_params>` for details).
* ``node-stats-include-thread-pools`` (default: ``true``): A boolean indicating whether thread pool stats should be included.
* ``node-stats-include-buffer-pools`` (default: ``true``): A boolean indicating whether buffer pool stats should be included.
* ``node-stats-include-breakers`` (default: ``true``): A boolean indicating whether circuit breaker stats should be included.
* ``node-stats-include-gc`` (default: ``true``): A boolean indicating whether JVM gc stats should be included.
* ``node-stats-include-mem`` (default: ``true``): A boolean indicating whether JVM heap stats should be included.
* ``node-stats-include-network`` (default: ``true``): A boolean indicating whether network-related stats should be included.
* ``node-stats-include-process`` (default: ``true``): A boolean indicating whether process cpu stats should be included.
* ``node-stats-include-indexing-pressure`` (default: ``true``): A boolean indicating whether indexing pressuer stats should be included.

recovery-stats
--------------

The recovery-stats telemetry device regularly calls the `indices recovery API <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-recovery.html>`_ and records one metrics document per shard.

Supported telemetry parameters:

* ``recovery-stats-indices`` (default: all indices): An index pattern for which recovery stats should be checked.
* ``recovery-stats-sample-interval`` (default 1): A positive number greater than zero denoting the sampling interval in seconds.

ccr-stats
---------

The ccr-stats telemetry device regularly calls the `cross-cluster replication stats API <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ccr-get-stats.html>`_ and records one metrics document per shard.

Supported telemetry parameters:

* ``ccr-stats-indices`` (default: all indices): An index pattern for which ccr stats should be checked.
* ``ccr-stats-sample-interval`` (default 1): A positive number greater than zero denoting the sampling interval in seconds.

transform-stats
---------------

The transform-stats telemetry device regularly calls the `transform stats API <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/get-transform-stats.html>` and records one metrics document per transform.

Supported telemetry parameters:

* ``transform-stats-transforms`` (default: all transforms): A list of transforms per cluster for which transform stats should be checked.
* ``transform-stats-sample-interval`` (default 1): A positive number greater than zero denoting the sampling interval in seconds.
