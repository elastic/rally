Quickstart
==========

Rally is developed for Unix and is actively tested on Linux and MacOS. Rally supports `benchmarking Elasticsearch clusters running on Windows <http://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html#benchmarking-an-existing-cluster>`_ but Rally itself needs to be installed on machines running Unix.

Install
-------

Install Python 3.8+ including ``pip3``, git 1.9+ and an `appropriate JDK to run Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm>`_ Be sure that ``JAVA_HOME`` points to that JDK. Then run the following command, optionally prefixed by ``sudo`` if necessary::

    pip3 install esrally


If you have any trouble or need more detailed instructions, look in the :doc:`detailed installation guide </install>`.

Run your first race
-------------------

Now we're ready to run our first :doc:`race </glossary>`::

    esrally --distribution-version=6.5.3

This will download Elasticsearch 6.5.3 and run Rally's default :doc:`track </glossary>` - the `geonames track <https://github.com/elastic/rally-tracks/tree/master/geonames>`_ - against it. After the race, a :doc:`summary report </summary_report>` is written to the command line:::
